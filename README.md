# Launch countdown timer

So I made this counter that counts how many days, hours, minutes and seconds are until May 28, 2021 15:31:37. I got the starter files from frontend mentors. I used `create-react-app`, `styled-components` and normalize to set the default styling. You can visit the project [here](https://launch-countdown-timer-12.netlify.app/)
